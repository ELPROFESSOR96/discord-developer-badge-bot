So first you must make a repl in <a href="https://replit.com" target="_blank">Replit</a> imported off this repo.

set the run command to python3 main_bot.py

Once it's run through you must get your bot token so go to <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications" target="_blank">Discord Developer Portal</a>

Once you have the token input in the repl code where it says at the bottom

Next make the bot join by getting the join link, so go to OAuth2 and then go to url generator.

Tick the bot box and the administrator then scroll to the bottom of the URL generator 


second last thing to do after adding the bot to your server is setting the guild to the testing server id so the commands update quickly

After that run this in the shell " python3 main_bot.py"

KEEP THE REPL OPEN AND RUNNING WHEN YOU USE THE BOT COMMAND!

And run the command in the server
