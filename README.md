So first you must make a repl in replit imported off this repo.

next you must run this in the SHELL, not the console "python3 -m pip install -U nextcord".

wait for the command to run through.

Once it's run through you must get your bot token so go to https://discord.com/developers/applications

Once you have the token input in the repl code where it says at the bottom

Next make the bot join your server so change the X to your client ID

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=X&permissions=8&scope=bot

second last thing to do after adding the bot to your server is setting the guild to the testing server id so the commands update quickly

After that run this in the shell "$ python3 main_bot.py"

And run the command in the server
